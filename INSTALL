= Installing Alexandria

Alexandria is written in Ruby with a GTK+2/GNOME user-interface. It
currently only runs on UNIX-style systems, such as GNU/Linux.

Alexandria is not an easy project to build from scratch. Apart from
Ruby and GNOME, it has a lot of dependencies; however, many of these
are now optional as detailed below. Once the dependencies have been
installed, building and installing Alexandria is relatively
straightforward.

== Dependencies

The {Ruby-GNOME2}[http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/] user-interface
involves a number of packages:

* <tt>ruby-gtk2</tt>
* <tt>ruby-gnome2</tt>
* <tt>ruby-libglade2</tt>
* <tt>ruby-gconf2</tt>

<tt>ruby-gettext</tt>[http://ponx.s5.xrea.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html]
is required for the internationalisation of the user interface.

== Build Dependencies

+rake+[http://rake.rubyforge.org] is required to build Alexandria from
the project +Rakefile+.

The non-Ruby +gettext+[http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext] package is
also needed to generate the binary +mo+ files used by
<tt>ruby-gettext</tt> at runtime.

== Optional Dependencies

=== Ruby/Amazon

For the <b>Amazon</b> book provider, you will need
<tt>ruby-amazon</tt>[http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-amazon.shtml],
which provides a Ruby interface to Amazon Web Services (AWS) including
book search.

=== Ruby/ZOOM and Yaz

For Z39.50 support and and the <b>Library of Congress</b> and
<b>British Library</b> book providers you will need
<tt>ruby-zoom</tt>[http://ruby-zoom.rubyforge.org], which in turn
requires the non-Ruby package +yaz+[http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz].

The Z39.50 Object-Orientation Model (ZOOM) is an international
standard for communication between computer systems, particularly
libraries and information-related systems.

=== Mechanize and Hpricot

For the <b>Deastore</b> book provider, you will need
+mechanize+[http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize], which in turn
requires +hpricot+[http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot].

Mechanize provides a Ruby package for stateful programmatic web
browsing. It is used for "scraping" web sites, extracting data
programatically from ordinary web pages. It uses Hpricot as its HTML
parser.

=== image_size

You will need
<tt>image_size</tt>[http://rubyforge.org/projects/imagesize/] for
optimizing the cover images in exported libraries.

== Build and Install

To build Alexandria, go to the base project directory (where the
Rakefile and this INSTALL file are located) and issue the command
    rake build

You must have root priveledges to install, so use +su+
    su -c 'rake install'
or +sudo+
    sudo rake install

Now you can check the version of the installed Alexandria
    alexandria --version

To launch Alexandria, simply use
    alexandria

If you wish to see more output on the console, you can use
    alexandria --debug
