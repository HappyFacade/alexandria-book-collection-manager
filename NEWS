Announcing the release of Alexandria 0.6.4

* What is Alexandria?
=====================

Alexandria is an application for managing a personal book library.
Its main recommending feature is its clean, intuitive interface.
Alexandria is able to retrieve book information and cover images from
a wide variety of online data sources. It also features extensive
import and export options, a loan interface, and smart libraries.
Alexandria is written in Ruby using ruby-gnome2.

* Where can I get it?
=====================

- A source package can be downloaded at http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=205
- An ad-hoc deb file (for Debian, Ubuntu & gNewSense) can be
  downloaded from there too
- SVN can be accessed here: http://alexandria.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/alexandria

* What's New in 0.6.4?
======================

New Dependencies:

- All web-based book providers now require Hpricot
  (a.k.a. libhpricot-ruby) for HTML and XML parsing
- DeaStore also requires HTMLEntities (a.k.a. libhtmlentities-ruby)

Changes:

  AWS-based Amazon provider
- Fixed several book providers (DeaStore, Siciliano, AdLibris & WorldCat)

  no settings interface yet, but you can run gconf-editor /apps/alexandria
  and set barcode_scanner to KeyboardWedge
