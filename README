Requirements
------------

    Ruby >= 1.8.0:              http://www.ruby-lang.org
    GNOME >= 2.6 [*]:           http://www.gnome.org
    Ruby/Amazon >= 0.8.3:       http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-amazon.shtml
    Ruby-GetText >= 0.6.1:      http://ponx.s5.xrea.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html
    Ruby-GNOME2 >= 0.12.0 [**]: http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp
    Ruby/ZOOM >= 0.2.0          http://ruby-zoom.rubyforge.org
    Intltool:                   http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fintltool

    [*]: GTK+ >= 2.6.0 is required though.

    [**]: Required libraries are: Ruby/Libglade2, Ruby/Gnome2, Ruby/GdkPixbuf2
                                  and Ruby/GConf2.

Install
-------

    $ ruby install.rb config
    $ ruby install.rb setup
   ($ su)
    $ ruby install.rb install
    $ gconftool-2 --shutdown [*]
    $ gconftool-2 --unset '/apps/alexandria/providers_priority' [**] 

    [*]: This is needed because the current GConf implementation won't
    dynamically reload the schemas.  Note that you don't have to start it
    after that, it should be automatically spawned when needed. 

    [**]: This step is only mandatory if you are upgrading from a 0.3.x
    or a newer version.  It will introduce new providers. 

Usage
-----

    $ alexandria
