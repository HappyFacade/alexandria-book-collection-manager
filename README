        keyword ; 
      * saves data using the YAML format ;
      * features an HIG-compliant user interface ;
      * shows books in different views (standard list or icons list), that can
        be either filtered or sorted ;
      * handles book rating and notes ;
      * includes translations for several languages.

Requirements
------------

    Ruby >= 1.8.0:              http://www.ruby-lang.org
    GNOME >= 2.6:               http://www.gnome.org
    Ruby/Amazon >= 0.8.3:       http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-amazon.shtml
    Ruby-GetText >= 0.5.4:      http://ponx.s5.xrea.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html
    Ruby-GNOME2 >= 0.9.x [*]:   http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp

    [*]: Required libraries are: Ruby/Libglade2, Ruby/Gnome2, Ruby/GdkPixbuf2
                                 and Ruby/GConf2.

Install
-------

    $ ruby install.rb config
    $ ruby install.rb setup
   ($ su)
    $ ruby install.rb install
    $ gconftool-2 --shutdown [*]

    [*]: This is needed because the current GConf implementation won't
    dynamically reload the schemas.  Note that you don't have to start it after
    that, it should be automatically spawned when needed. 

Usage
-----

    $ alexandria
