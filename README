== 0.6.2 Release

Alexandria 0.6.2 is the first official release of the program in over
two years. (Alexandria 0.6.1 was released in 2005.)  The software is
still slightly sketchy at the moment as the new maintainers are not
fully experienced with the release process.

Alexandria has been tested in beta for a few months now, and most
issues to do with upgrading from earlier versions are believed to be
resolved. However, you should still back up your library (the
~/.alexandria directory) before you run the new version.

If you encounter any problems, please leave a bug report on the
Tracker at RubyForge <http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=205>

If you want to help with the development of Alexandria, please join
the alexandria-list mailing list.

== Installation

There are full instructions for installing Alexandria from source in the 
file INSTALL, including information about all the dependencies.

If you are installing on a Debian-based system, things should be easier as
the dependencies are handled automatically (although, at the moment, there
is no up-to-date Debian package for Ruby/ZOOM - you will have to install it
from source, see INSTALL for details).

To run the program, just type
    alexandria
or, to get verbose debugging information,
    alexandria --debug

If you are running GNOME, Alexandria should appear under the
'Applications > Office' menu.
