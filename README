== 0.6.3 Release

For full release notes, see the file NEWS.


== Installation

There are full instructions for installing Alexandria from source in the 
file INSTALL, including information about all the dependencies.

If you are installing on a Debian-based system, things should be
easier as the dependencies can be handled automatically (although, at
the moment, there is no up-to-date Debian package for Ruby/ZOOM - you
will have to install it from source, see INSTALL for details).

To run the program, just type
    alexandria
or, to get verbose debugging information,
    alexandria --debug

If you are running GNOME, Alexandria should appear under the
'Applications > Office' menu.
