= Bugs and Shortcomings

There are a couple of well known, long-standing issues with
Alexandria. These issues will, hopefully, be addressed in upcoming
releases. There are also specific bugs tracked on RubyForge:
<http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=205>

== User-Interface Responsiveness

Some long-running actions (particularly looking up book details from
online providers) are not fully threaded. This means that the
user-interface appears to "hang" when you enter an ISBN. 

There is also insufficient feedback to tell the user that multiple
providers are being searched.

== Icon Display Spacing

While the list view of books is naturally neat, the default icon view
suffers from problematic icon spacing; often the book covers appear to
be randomly scattered. They cannot even be adjusted afterwards. This
is just an aesthetic concern, but a frustrating one. (It's frustrating
for us as developers too! We don't know what causes it or how to fix
it. Any help would be appreciated.)

== Multiple Copies of Books

The limited expressiveness of Alexandria's domain model means that it
is not possible to keep a record of more than one copy of a given book
in a single library.

== Large Collections

The user-interface becomes slow and unresponsive when dealing with
libraries over about 100 books. This is quite a low threshold on
scalability.
