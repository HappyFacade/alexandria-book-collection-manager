So you want to use your cuecat scanner with Alexandria.  First off, you'll need
kernel version 2.4.  To my knowledge, nobody has created a cuecat driver for
(recent) 2.6 kernels.  If I'm wrong, please let me know.  Head to the
Alexandria rubyforge download page[1] and get the latest version of the
cuecat_async_patch tarball.  The README in there will instruct you where to
download the driver and how to patch it.

Once you get the driver setup and installed, you should have a
/dev/scanners/cuecat file.  If run 'cat /dev/scanners/cuecat' and scan stuff,
it should output the information.  Make sure this works before you try to get
Alexandria to work with the scanner.  If your device file lives somewhere else,
you can set the path in GConf at /apps/alexandria/cuecat_device.  

Start up Alexandria.  When you get into the Add Book you should see the little
barcode icon in the top right lit up.  This means the scanner was found.  When
you can something, the barcode should appear in the ISBN textbox.

This feature is fairly untested.  If you have any problems, feel free to post
them to the Alexandria mailing list.
